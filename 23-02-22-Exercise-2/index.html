                <p class="default-p">Say you’ve got a
                    <strong>
                        <Card />
                    </strong> component. It’s highly likely it
                    shouldn’t be butted right up against any other components with no spacing
                    around it. That’s true for… pretty much every component. So, how do you
                    handle component spacing in a design system?

                <h2 class="small-title">A whistle-stop tour of 4 new CSS color features</h2>
                <p class="default-p">I was just writing in my <a class="normal-link" href="#">“What’s new in since
                        CSS3?”</a> article about recent and possible future changes to CSS colors. It’s weirdly a lot.
                    There are just as many or more new and upcoming ways to define colors than
                    what we have now. I thought we’d take a really quick look.
                    <br /><br />
                    First, a major heads up. This stuff is so complicated. I barely understand it.
                    But here are some aspects:
                    <br /><br />
                <ul class="dot-list">
                    <li>Before all this upcoming change, we only had RGB as a color model, and everything dealt with
                        that.</li>
                    <li>We had different “color spaces” that handled it differently (e.g. the rgb() function mapped that
                        RGB color model as a cube with linear coordinates, the hsl() function mapped that RGB color
                        model as a cylinder) but it was all sRGB gamut.</li>
                    <li>With the upcoming changes, we’re getting new color models and (!) we’re getting new functions
                        that map that color model differently. So I think it’s kind of a double-triple whammy.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="default-p">A custom <a class="normal-link" href="#">Favicon</a> is a great way to polish a web
                    project. It displays on desktop browser tabs, and also inside "save for later" readers, other blog
                    posts linking to your site, and more. Traditionally this has been done with the .ico file type, but
                    recently browsers have allowed use of <a class="normal-link" href="#">SVG</a>, a vector format.
