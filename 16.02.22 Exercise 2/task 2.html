                <p class="default-p">Building efficient web and mobile interfaces is
                    often challenging and requires the use of imperative logic.
                    React enables you to declaratively describe user interfaces in
                    terms of their state, and it will do the heavy lifting of natively
                    building them for you. In this course, React: Getting Started, you
                    will delve into the fundamental concepts about React and use them
                    to build practical web applications.
